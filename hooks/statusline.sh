# Snap statusline shim.
#
# This script REPLACES whatever was in your settings.json's `statusLine.command`
# field, but is engineered to be a transparent pass-through so your real
# statusline keeps working untouched.
#
# What it does, in order:
#
#   1. Reads the statusline JSON payload Claude Code piped on stdin.
#      (Same payload your old statusline received: model, cost, context, etc.)
#
#   2. If CLAUDE_SNAP_SIDECAR is set in the environment (i.e. running under
#      `claude-snap`), atomically writes that JSON to the sidecar file.
#      The snap Stop hook later reads the sidecar and merges its fields into
#      the final envelope on stdout.
#      When the env var is NOT set (a regular interactive session that just
#      happens to have these hooks installed), this step is skipped, with
#      zero side effects.
#
#   3. Hands the visible TUI rendering back to your original statusline by
#      pipe-feeding the same JSON to it. The shim resolves "your original"
#      in this order:
#        a. $CLAUDE_SNAP_REAL_STATUSLINE if exported (explicit override)
#        b. the contents of <CFG_DIR>/.snap-prior-statusline (sidecar file
#           install.sh writes with the statusLine.command it replaced)
#        c. nothing — the script prints no statusline output, so Claude Code
#           shows a blank one. Safe default for users who never configured
#           a statusline in the first place.
#
# Wiring is handled by install.sh:
#   - statusLine.command in settings.json points at THIS script.
#   - install.sh saves whatever statusLine.command was there before into the
#     sidecar file above, so the shim picks it up with no shell rc edits.
#

input=$(cat)

# Step 2: snap-mode sidecar write.
# Atomic via tmp-then-rename so a partial read from the Stop hook is impossible.

  printf '%s' "$input" > "$tmp"
  mv "$tmp" "$CLAUDE_SNAP_SIDECAR"
  if [ -n "${CLAUDE_SNAP_DEBUG_LOG:-}" ]; then
    # One jq call extracts both fields formatted; cheaper than two parses
    # of the same payload on a hot tick.
    fields=$(printf '%s' "$input" | jq -r '"cost=\(.cost.total_cost_usd // "?") pct=\(.context_window.used_percentage // "?")"' 2>/dev/null || echo "cost=? pct=?")

# Step 3: transparent pass-through to the user's real statusline.
# Resolve the target command: env var first, then the sidecar file. `eval`
# because the resolved command may be multi-word (e.g. "jq -r '...'" with
# embedded quoting). User-controlled either way, so eval is acceptable.
