# Install the claude-pty hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json (or the directory pointed
# at by CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR). Idempotent: safe to re-run.
#
# Two ways to invoke:
#
#   1. From a checked-out copy of this repo:
#        ./install.sh
#      The script writes hook paths pointing at the directory it lives in.
#
#   2. Via curl, with nothing on disk:
#        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p/main/install.sh | bash
#      The script detects it has no sibling hooks/ directory, fetches the
#      runtime files directly from raw.githubusercontent into
#      $CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_HOME (default: ~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p),
#      then re-execs itself from that location so step 1's logic runs.
#      No git clone, just curl.
#
# Env vars honored:
#   CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR             config dir to write to. Default: ~/.claude
#   CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_HOME     where to drop files in curl mode.
#                                 Default: ~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p
#   CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_REPO     GitHub owner/repo in curl mode.
#                                 Default: CJHwong/claude-interactive-p
#   CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_REF      branch/tag/sha to fetch from raw.gh in curl
#                                 mode. Default: main
#   CLAUDE_PTY_NO_STATUSLINE     when 1, skip wiring statusLine.command — only
#                                 the Stop hook is installed. For callers that
#                                 don't consume the statusline subtree (and that
#                                 serialize startup themselves, since without the
#                                 shim the lock's release signal never arrives).
