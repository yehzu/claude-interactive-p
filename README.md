# claude-interactive-p

A drop-in replacement for `claude -p --output-format=json` that runs through interactive mode under a PTY, so the JSON envelope includes the statusline-only fields `-p` doesn't expose: `rate_limits.{five_hour, seven_day}` with reset times, `context_window.used_percentage`, `exceeds_200k_tokens`, `fast_mode`, `output_style`, and the rest.

Built for [claude-on-the-fly](https://github.com/CJHwong/claude-on-the-fly), which needs visibility into rate limits and context usage that `-p` doesn't surface.

## How it works

Three pieces:

- `bin/claude-snap` spawns `claude "prompt"` under a PTY (via `script(1)`), captures the JSON envelope after the turn finishes, and prints it on stdout.
- `hooks/statusline.sh` is a transparent shim. When the snap wrapper is active (env var set), it writes the raw statusline payload to a sidecar file. It always delegates the visible TUI rendering to `$CLAUDE_SNAP_REAL_STATUSLINE`, so your existing statusline keeps working.
- `hooks/stop_envelope.sh` fires when the assistant turn finishes. It polls the sidecar for the post-response statusline tick (which lands ~300ms after Stop due to debounce), writes the merged envelope, and SIGTERMs the parent claude process so the TUI exits.

Without the snap env vars present, both hooks no-op and the statusline shim passes through unchanged, so it's safe to leave installed in your real `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Compatibility

Tested against Claude Code `2.1.146`. The Stop hook relies on `last_assistant_message` in its stdin payload, which is undocumented and could be renamed or removed in future versions. If a Claude Code update breaks the envelope, that field is the first thing to check. The fallback is to read the assistant response from `transcript_path` instead.

## Install

Run the installer straight from GitHub:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p/main/install.sh | bash
```

It fetches the runtime files (`bin/claude-snap`, the two hook scripts, `uninstall.sh`) into `~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p` via curl (no `git clone`), then runs the local install path. Override the destination with `CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_HOME`, the source ref with `CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_REF` (default `main`).

`install.sh` backs up `~/.claude/settings.json`, points `statusLine.command` at the shim, appends the Stop hook (deduped), and prints the `CLAUDE_SNAP_REAL_STATUSLINE` export you should add to your shell rc.

Requires `curl` and `jq`. Optionally set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` before running to install into a non-default config dir. Re-run the curl line to update.

## Use

```bash
~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p/bin/claude-snap --model haiku "Reply with only the word PONG." | jq
```

Output is a single JSON object on stdout. Top-level shape is a superset of `claude -p --output-format=json` (every `-p` key is present), plus `statusline` and a few session fields (`cwd`, `permission_mode`, `transcript_path`, `background_tasks`, `session_crons`).

See `examples/usage.sh` and `examples/usage.py` for integration templates.

## Caveats

- `ttft_ms` is always `null`. Time-to-first-token isn't surfaced by any hook channel; capturing it would require a stream-parsing shim that isn't built.
- `terminal_reason` is always `"completed"` because the wrapper always SIGTERMs after Stop. No distinction from error exit.
- `permission_denials` and `api_error_status` are stubs. Derivable from the transcript but format-fragile; not implemented.
- `num_turns` counts every `assistant` record (including `ai-title` generation), so it can be higher than `-p`'s.
- Wall-clock is ~1-2s slower than plain `-p` due to TUI bringup and the post-response statusline poll.

## Uninstall

```bash
~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p/uninstall.sh
```

Removes the shim from `statusLine.command` and the Stop hook entry. Other hooks and settings keys are left alone. Backup is written first.
