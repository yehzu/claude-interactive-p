# claude-interactive-p

A drop-in replacement for `claude -p --output-format=json` that runs through interactive mode under a PTY to surface statusline fields `-p` doesn't expose: rate limits, context window usage, fast mode state, and more.

Built for [claude-on-the-fly](https://github.com/CJHwong/claude-on-the-fly).

## Tutorial

If you just want to try it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then run a prompt:

```bash
~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p/bin/claude-pty --model haiku "Reply with only the word PONG." | jq
```

The output is a JSON object — a superset of `claude -p --output-format=json` with `statusline` and session fields added.

To remove it:

```bash
~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p/uninstall.sh
```

Requires `curl` and `jq`.

## How-to Guides

### Install without the statusline shim

If you only need the Stop hook (you don't consume statusline output in your TUI):

```bash
CLAUDE_PTY_NO_STATUSLINE=1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p/main/install.sh | bash
```

This skips wiring `statusLine.command`. At runtime you also need `CLAUDE_PTY_NO_LOCK=1` since the statusline shim is what releases the startup lock — without it the lock never signals and the wrapper hangs on the hard timeout.

### Watch a live turn with tmux

```bash
CLAUDE_PTY_TMUX_SESSION=watch claude-pty --model sonnet "Explain this codebase."
```

Then in another terminal:

```bash
tmux attach -t watch
```

You see claude's live TUI. Any tmux failure falls back to the `script` PTY so it never costs a turn.

### Drive from Python

```python
from examples.usage import claude_pty

envelope = claude_pty("Summarize this file.", model="sonnet")
print(envelope["result"])
print(envelope["statusline"]["cost"]["total_cost_usd"])
```

### Drive from shell

```bash
envelope=$(claude-pty --model haiku "Reply PONG.")
echo "$envelope" | jq '{result, total_cost_usd, context_pct: .statusline.context_window.used_percentage}'
```

### Update to latest

Re-run the curl line. It fetches current runtime files and re-wires hooks idempotently:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Use a custom config dir

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/claude-test curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CJHwong/claude-interactive-p/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Debug a stuck or failing run

```bash
CLAUDE_PTY_DEBUG_LOG=/tmp/pty-debug.log claude-pty --model haiku "test"
cat /tmp/pty-debug.log
```

## Reference

### CLI

```
claude-pty [claude flags...] "prompt"
```

All claude flags (`--model`, `--permission-mode`, etc.) pass through. `--help`, `--version` pass straight to claude. `--bare` is rejected — it disables hooks, which claude-pty depends on.

### Env vars

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.claude` | Config dir claude reads; hooks must be installed here |
| `CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_HOME` | `~/.local/share/claude-interactive-p` | Where curl bootstrap drops runtime files |
| `CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_REPO` | `CJHwong/claude-interactive-p` | GitHub repo for curl bootstrap |
| `CLAUDE_INTERACTIVE_P_REF` | `main` | Branch/tag for curl bootstrap |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_NO_STATUSLINE` | unset | Set to `1` to skip statusline wiring at install |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_YES` | unset | Set to `1` to skip the install confirmation prompt |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_TMUX_SESSION` | unset | Tmux session name for live-turn watching |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_NO_LOCK` | unset | Set to `1` to skip startup serialization |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_LOCK_WAIT_SEC` | `600` | Max seconds to wait for the startup lock |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_LOCK_HOLD_SEC` | `10` | Max seconds to hold the lock if sidecar never appears |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_STALL_SEC` | `45` | Seconds the screen may stay frozen with no envelope before the turn is declared stalled and killed (`0` disables) |
| `CLAUDE_PTY_DEBUG_LOG` | unset | File path for debug event log |

### JSON envelope shape

Superset of `claude -p --output-format=json`. Every `-p` key is present, plus:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `statusline` | Full statusline payload (cost, context_window, rate_limits, fast_mode, output_style) |
| `cwd` | Stop hook |
| `permission_mode` | Stop hook |
| `transcript_path` | Stop hook |
| `background_tasks` | Stop hook |
| `session_crons` | Stop hook |
| `num_turns` | Parsed from transcript JSONL |
| `stop_reason` | Parsed from transcript JSONL |
| `usage` | Parsed from transcript JSONL |
| `modelUsage` | Aggregated from transcript JSONL, grouped by model |
| `duration_ms` | Wall-clock measured by the wrapper |
| `duration_api_ms` | From statusline `cost.total_api_duration_ms` |
| `fast_mode_state` | `"on"` / `"off"` from statusline |

Stubs (always present, not implemented):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `ttft_ms` | `null` |
| `permission_denials` | `[]` |
| `api_error_status` | `null` |

### Failure envelope

A turn that never completes still produces a JSON envelope on stdout (exit
code 1). This happens when the TUI gets stuck on a screen that can't proceed
headlessly — a usage-limit notice, a login wizard, a permission dialog — or
when claude dies before the Stop hook fires. The stall watcher kills claude
once the screen has been frozen for `CLAUDE_PTY_STALL_SEC` seconds with no
envelope, then emits:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `is_error` | `true` |
| `terminal_reason` | `"stalled"` (frozen screen) or `"no_envelope"` (claude died) |
| `result` | Last visible screen lines, ANSI-stripped — e.g. the rate-limit message |
| `subtype` | `"error_during_execution"` |

On success `terminal_reason` is `"completed"` and `is_error` is `false`.

### Files installed

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bin/claude-pty` | Wrapper binary |
| `hooks/statusline.sh` | Statusline shim (sidecar writer + pass-through) |
| `hooks/stop_envelope.sh` | Stop hook (envelope writer) |
| `install.sh` | Installer |
| `uninstall.sh` | Uninstaller |

Settings.json mutations:

- `statusLine.command` → statusline shim (unless `CLAUDE_PTY_NO_STATUSLINE=1`)
- `.hooks.Stop[]` → Stop hook appended (deduped)
- Backup written to `settings.json.bak.<timestamp>` before mutation
- Prior statusline saved to `.pty-prior-statusline` for transparent delegation

## Explanation

### Why not just `claude -p`?

`claude -p --output-format=json` doesn't include rate limit counters, context window usage, fast mode state, or output style. Those fields only flow through the interactive TUI's statusline hook. claude-pty runs the interactive TUI under a PTY so the statusline shim can capture that data and fold it into the output envelope.

### Pipeline

Three pieces run per turn:

1. **`bin/claude-pty`** acquires the startup lock, then launches `claude` under a PTY (either `script` or tmux). It polls for the envelope file and terminates claude when it appears.

2. **`hooks/statusline.sh`** replaces your `statusLine.command`. When `CLAUDE_PTY_SIDECAR` is set, it atomically writes each statusline tick to a sidecar file. It always delegates rendering to your real statusline (resolved from `CLAUDE_PTY_REAL_STATUSLINE`, then `.pty-prior-statusline`, then nothing).

3. **`hooks/stop_envelope.sh`** fires on Stop. It waits for the post-response statusline tick (debounced ~300ms behind Stop), merges Stop stdin + sidecar into a draft envelope, and writes it atomically. The envelope's appearance is the "turn done" signal.

Without the claude-pty env vars, both hooks no-op — safe to leave installed in your real config.

### Who kills claude

The wrapper kills claude, not the Stop hook. The hook used to `kill $PPID`, but newer Claude Code wraps hook commands in a shell — `$PPID` was that shell, claude survived, the wrapper blocked forever, and the process tree leaked. Owning the kill means the wrapper knows the real child pid (and, in tmux mode, the session).

### Startup lock

Claude's TUI mode races on a singleton supervisor lock during the first ~1s of boot. Two TUIs starting simultaneously leave one or both hung. claude-pty serializes only that window with a mkdir-based lock at `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.pty-lock/`. Once the statusline sidecar appears (claude reached steady state), the lock is released so the next caller can start. Stale locks from dead holders are stolen automatically.

### Compatibility

Tested against Claude Code `2.1.146`. The Stop hook reads `last_assistant_message` from stdin — undocumented, could be renamed or removed. If it breaks, the fallback is `transcript_path`.

### Caveats

- `ttft_ms` is always `null`. No hook channel surfaces time-to-first-token.
- `num_turns` counts all `assistant` records including `ai-title` generation, so it can be higher than `-p`'s count.
- Wall-clock is ~1-2s slower than plain `-p` due to TUI bringup and statusline poll.
